    <h1>Vision</h1>
    <p>Frostytruffle.com was set up in January 2017 with a vision to revolutionize online shopping in Nepal. We aim to create a culture among Nepalese business industries where customers come first. Having served over hundreds of satisfied customers, we take full pride in saying that we have been able to create happiness among our customers, majority of which are females. Our long-term vision is to create an ultimate platform for all girls and women in Nepal where they can buy, share, express, or even sell anything they want. That is how we have envisioned our company in future, a one stop platform for everything a girl wishes to have.</p>
