    <h1>Our Goal</h1>
    <p>The reason we came up with this idea is because we’ve seen many cake shops or online platforms who claim that they would make exactly as the customer wants but in reality, they do something else or not even close to what they’ve insured. And the quality is not even worth paying the money for. Thus, we established this frostytruffle.com to insure our customers that we not only provide you with the gorgeous looking cakes but the testiest ones you’ve ever had. Of course, we also want to make profit out of it as every other business out there but that is not the only focus. We want to stay in the market forever and the only way we can achieve that goal is by providing our customers what they deserve and what they pay for.</p>
