    <p>By keeping Advertise cost to the minimum we keep our productâ€™s cost to the lowest we can. Instead of spending ton of money in useless adds, we focus on the quality of the product and believe that the customers itself will advertise the product by sharing their experience to their friends. That way the money we could have spent on the adds can help us keep the price to the lowest.   p>
