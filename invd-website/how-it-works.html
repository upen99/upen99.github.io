    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <p>This is an online platform where you can come and get any designs of cake you could possible think of. We do have our own design but you’re more than welcome to bring your own design if you would like to. You can do that any ways you want. We have had customers sending us a sketched or drawing of the kind of design they want or photoshop your design if you’re familiar with it and we’ll put all our effort make a cake exactly as you want</p>
