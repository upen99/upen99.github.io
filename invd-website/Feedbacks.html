    <p>As described earlier, we’ve zero unhandled complains so far and we are doing everything we could to keep that number as zero in the future as well. We highly appreciate all the feedback, whether they are good or bad as we believe that the customers feedback is something that helps us improve and become better. We even reward two person every-week for their honest feedback. We also grantee a full cash back if you’re not satisfied with your purchase. If you think that what you got is not worth what you paid for we will take the product back and return your cash but luckily, we haven’t had that situation ever. All in all, our main and only focus is you, our customers and we will do everything we could to keep our customers happy and satisfied. If you have any idea or suggestion on how we can do better, you’re more than welcome to share it with us. After reviewing and analyzing your ideas If we like it or if it goes along </p>
